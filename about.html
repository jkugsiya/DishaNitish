        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            <strong>DishaNitish technologies</strong> is well-positioned to capitalize on this demand. We are a leader in the provision of comprehensive outsourced IT solutions for small to mid-sized businesses, have a strong market presence, a compelling set of offerings, and the technical wherewithal to exploit this business opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we are well-positioned, in order to maximize our business potential, we require additional financing in order to aggressively acquire Cloud customers and crystallize our market share in advance of potential competitors. This is a critical time, as Cloud computing moves into the mainstream. Those who obtain strong positions in their chosen niches first will be very difficult to displace later.
        </p>
        <p>
            As is detailed later in this Business Plan, we estimate our incremental financing requirement to be in the order of $500k. We seek additional operating lines of credit in this amount, in order to finance our customer acquisition efforts and make certain other critical investments in infrastructure. These we anticipate driving a period of negative cash flow lasting roughly 15 months and being fully recaptured within a 26-month period.
        </p>
        <p>
            If successful in our Cloud endeavors, we stand to significantly expand both our revenue and our business valuations. As this Business Plan will detail, we believe that successfully capitalizing on this business opportunity could over the next 4 years increase the value of our business by as much as $15-20m, as well as either position it for further growth by way of an IPO, or monetize our gains by way of a sale of the business.
