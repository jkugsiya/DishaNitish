                The promise of GIS has always been that it would allow us to obtain better answers to our Questions. But this is only possible if we have tools that allow us to perform rigorous quantitative analyses designed for spatial data. GIS provides us with a suite of analysis and modeling tools, ranging from small building blocks that you can use to construct a sophisticated work-flow, to completely self-contained analysis programs. It has a greater range of analysis and modeling tools, supports batch processing, offers new graphing functionality, automatically records work-flows for future reference, supports geodatabases, and can be called programmatically. It consists of algorithms that detect movement or changes in live and recorded video to see whether the movement or changes mean a possible threat is about to occur, occurring, or has occurred. One can also monitor video footage for missing or unwanted objects. Objects that have been left behind (bag containing a bomb) can be detected when the video from a CCTV camera displays an object not part of the normal video scene. This causes it to trigger an alarm within your CCTV s ystem. Video analytics can also do the reverse. When a camera within your CCTV system has a change in the video scene that shows that an object is missing an alarm can be triggered. A command and control user interface which leverages GIS technology can be used in emergency/crime responses to locate intruders and response vehicles and personnel on the geographic map as well. This enables security personnel to orchestrate a coordinated response.

                I propose information physics view of interface objects that we think provides an effective complement to traditional metaphor-based approaches. While an informational physics strategy for interface design certainly involves metaphor, author says there is much that is distinctive about a physics-based approach. While there are ease-of-use benefits from such mappings, they also orient designers towards mimicking mechanisms of earlier media rather than towards exploring potentially more effective computer-based mechanisms. Semantic zooming is but one example mechanism that I think more naturally arises from adopting an informational physics strategy. <br> <br>

                This paper dealt with the complete methodology to detect the explosives. Since itâ€™s a real-time mission and radar base done, government authorization and involvement is necessary. We laid radar systems in the coastal zone to acquire the weather. To validate the work, real-time radar data is required .Since that is not that much easy to have. only the methodology is discussed I this paper. Limitations are also takes place in the such as ground based sensor can be disturbed by people as it be located at road sides and Confusing gents like crackers and liquid explosives can also be detected as explosive. But the above limitations can be controlled by adopting proper designing of the project. Even though this kind of study is very popular in foreign countries: they only adopted radar systems to find out the explosives
