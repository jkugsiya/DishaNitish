                Educators at Indian university haven not started using high level programming language with FOS to teach computational physics. I am going to describes how graphical visualizations also play an important role, which I illustrate with few examples. Every computer student should understand the concept of trinity and floating point. Here the trinity words means: Mathematics, Physics and Informatics. A concept of trinity gave me idea to work on the principle of Physics (classical and quantum) and computer science together. As we know that Mathematics is the mother of computer science and physics gave a structure of computer which gave a new theory & concept of Informatics. Here I explain with concepts of physics and their relation and with high level programming language in FOS as well as in windows, mac-os. While it is possible to introduce the Quantum computation in a strictly algebraic manner without ever mentioning “real world” things like electrons, particle states or charge density, some basic knowledge about general quantum physics can vastly improve the understanding of why certain quantum algorithms or programming techniques actually work and a good precaution against common misconceptions’.

                An important distinction needs to be made between quantum mechanics, quantum physics and quantum computing. Quantum mechanics is a mathematical language, much like calculus. Just as classical physics uses calculus to explain nature, quantum physics uses quantum mechanics to understand or explain the nature. Just as classical computers can be thought of Boolean algebra terms, quanta computers are reasoned about with quanta mechanics. There are four postulates to quanta mechanics, which will form the basis of interface. <br> <br>

                This report gives an explanation to what a physics engine consists of and how it works. I have not concentrated so much on algorithms used in a physics engine or how the algorithms work. For the interested reader, algorithms and implementation code, to name a few. Instead, author has given an explanation to what the physics engine do that may be easy to understand for most readers. There are many ways to implement a physics engine and author present an overlook of how a typical physics engine work. An important part in the physics engine is the constraints, used for collision response and joints. This part of the paper was for getting a good basic knowledge of physics engines and to give a better understanding for the rest of the paper. Since a physics engine can simulate more than just rigid bodies, I described in short how deformable objects can be modeled and how particle systems work; this was to describe what a physics engine is capable of. I chose a few physics engines and made a short overview of them, showing what their functionalities consisted of and chose two of them for a closer look. All functionality in this interface depends on the engine used. If this work is taken in R&D with crustier, this can give a new concept on technology like explosive detection of planted or implanted via satellite. It can also give new path in nuclear development. This interface can also give a new path in internet service to increase it bandwidth of 2 GB/s data flow. And many more scope which can give a new question mark on technology. Very important through this interface there is no black hole in universe. My next publication will be in Black hole, describing its presence and advantage.
