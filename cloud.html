            Any business tends to look forward in making more and more profits by cutting unnecessary costs and the organization can only achieve this through cloud application development.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            Benefit of using computing services is that companies/organizations can stave off the upfront cost and insolubility of owning and sustain their own IT infrastructure. Instead of build-up their own data centers and infrastructure simply pay for what services they use and when they use it from cloud service provider (Like AWS, AZURE, GCP & many more cloud service provider in the Industry). 
        </p> <br>
        <p>
            Cloud Computing has clearly become a Strong Backbone in the Information Technology Era. The core concept behind computing services is moving organization workloads to a secure Environment so that they can concentrate on business development activities.

            <span>When to Use PaaS</span> <br>
            <p>
                Utilizing PaaS is beneficial, sometimes even necessary, in several situations. For example, PaaS can streamline workflows when multiple developers are working on the same development project. If other vendors must be included, PaaS can provide great speed and flexibility to the entire process. PaaS is particularly beneficial if you need to create customized applications. This cloud service also can greatly reduce costs and it can simplify some challenges that come up if you are rapidly developing or deploying an app.

            <span>When to Use IaaS:</span> <br>
            <p>
                Just as with SaaS and PaaS, there are specific situations when IaaS is most advantageous. Startups and small companies may prefer IaaS to avoid spending time and money on purchasing and creating hardware and software. Larger companies may prefer to retain complete control over their applications and infrastructure, but they want to purchase only what they actually consume or need. Companies experiencing rapid growth like the scalability of IaaS, and they can change out specific hardware and software easily as their needs evolve. Anytime you are unsure of a new application’s demands, IaaS offers plenty of flexibility and scalability.
